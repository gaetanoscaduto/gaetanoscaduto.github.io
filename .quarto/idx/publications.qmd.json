Out of this research effort, in addition to a monograph, the following publications arose:\n\n#### [Scaduto, G. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1093/poq/nfaf047). Politicultural Linking: Inferences between Political and Apolitical Traits. Public Opinion Quarterly, 89(3).\n\n-   This is my theoretical framework and literature review.
